abstract = {Abstract Objectives To evaluate the association between adherence to antimalarials and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods Using administrative health databases in British Columbia, Canada, we conducted a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with incident SLE and incident antimalarial use. We established antimalarial drug courses by defining a new course when a 90-day gap is exceeded between refills and calculated proportion days covered (PDC) for each course, and categorized medication taking as: 1) adherent (PDC ≥ 0.90); 2) non-adherent (0 < PDC < 0.90); and 3) discontinuer (no drug). T2DM outcomes were based on outpatient or inpatient visits, or anti-diabetic medication use. We used multivariable Cox’s proportional hazards models with time-dependent variables. Results Over median 4.62 years of follow-up in our incident cohort of 1,498 SLE patients (90.8\% women), we recorded 140 incident cases of T2DM. Multivariable hazard ratios were 0.61 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 - 0.93) for adherent and 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.50-1.22) for non-adherent respectively, as compared to discontinuers. Conclusion Our findings of a protective effect of adherence to antimalarials in preventing T2DM provides further support for the importance of adherence to antimalarials to obtain benefits of therapy.}
